## Who am I?

- I am an MSc student in Soil Science studying in Dr. Andy Black's [Biometeorology and Soil Physics Group](https://biomet.landfood.ubc.ca "My research group"). 
- I am also a Soil Scientist at [Integral Ecology Group](https://www.integralecologygroup.com/ "My company"). 

My work both professionally and as an MSc student pertains to the relationships between site and soil properties and ecosystem occurrence, particularly for [mine reclamation](https://www.integralecologygroup.com/projects/predicting-ecosystem-occurrence-for-mine-reclamation "My work").

When I'm not working, I enjoy going for walks and hikes, playing and watching hockey, cooking, and quality time with my favourite people.
