  Remarks:
  
  - easy to access, liked how you had a site map and links between questions
  - I learned how the kableExtra package works for colouring data in your table
  - To look at your code style and strategy, I would have preferred if you displayed your code in the html so I didn't have to open your Rmd file
  - having max on the left and min on the right of your first graph gave an illusion like GDP was decreasing. Maybe because I'm used to line graphs showing a trend over time.
  - informative notes on what you saw in the data
  - nice of you to include references and links to outside sources of code
  - good work on this!
