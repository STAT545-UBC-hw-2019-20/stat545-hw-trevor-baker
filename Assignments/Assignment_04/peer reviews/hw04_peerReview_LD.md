  Remarks:
  
  - good use of pivot_ and _join functions
  - I liked the explanations you gave with the code
  - for ex3_2 you could use "guest %>% anti_join(email2, by="name")" to get the answer in one line
  - I think your ex3_3 excludes people from the original guestlist who don't have emails, I think full_join was the correct function
  - ex3_2 and ex3_3 could use DT::datatable to display the data cleaner
  - I think because you named your readme file as "ReadMe_HM04.md" instead of README.md, it did not instantly give me the link when I accessed your hw04 repository
  - I agree that your second life expectancy graph shows the data better than the first
