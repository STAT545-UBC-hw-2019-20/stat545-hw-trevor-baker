  Remarks:
  
  - you used pivot_ and _join functions efficiently to complete the tasks
  - I learned some of the DT::datatable and knitr::kable() display options from your code
  - good use of labs() and scale_ options on your plot to make the display nicer
  - you could skip a step on some answers by piping directly into the datatable() or kable() functions
  - you could do the renaming in ex3_1 within the dplyr pipe using "%>% rename(name=guest)", but your way works just fine :)
  - very well done!
